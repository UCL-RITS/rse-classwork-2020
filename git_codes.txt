Set up your local copy
You will only need to do the following steps once. You may have already done some of these in the first class -- if so, you can skip those steps.

Fork the repository on GitHub.
Create a local copy of your fork on your computer by cloning it.
Go into your new directory in a terminal: cd rse-classwork-2020.
 So far, your local copy only knows about one remote (your fork). You can verify that with git remote -v.
Add the original repository as a new remote named upstream using one of the following:
git remote add upstream git@github.com:UCL-RITS/rse-classwork-2020.git (if you have SSH set up)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/UCL-RITS/rse-classwork-2020.git (otherwise)
Verify that the new remote has been added with git remove -v (it should now list upstream too).
